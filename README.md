You will need to install a few Python libraries to run the algorithms and handle data processing.
numpy==1.24.3
scipy==1.10.0    # Optional: For more complex optimization functions if needed
matplotlib==3.7.2  # Optional: For plotting results
heapq  # Already built-in in Python; no need to install separately
random  # Already built-in; handles randomness in genetic algorithms

This script runs:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path.
QIGA to find the best rerouted path for traffic optimization.
Quantum Annealing Simulation to optimize traffic light timings.
